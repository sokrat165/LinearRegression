# LinearRegression
--> The Cycle of Data Analysis uses is
1) Define the Problem and study the duman
2) Collect Data
3) Data Cleaning
4) Tasks:
Remove or impute missing values.
Identify and handle outliers.
Correct errors and inconsistencies.
5) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6) Feature Engineering
7)  Model Selection and Training
8)   Interpretation and Communication


--> Assumptions of Linear Regression:

1) Linearity
2) Independence
3) Homoscedasticity
4) Normality of Residuals
5) No Multicollinearity
--> Handling Outliers and Missing Values:
Remove outliers by filtering data within the 1st and 99th percentiles.
Remove missing data with less than 5% of data .
